# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Image Classification

This project demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using Python and deep learning frameworks. The notebook contains all the steps from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to classify images into different categories using a CNN model. It walks through the entire deep learning workflow, including:

- Loading and preprocessing image datasets
- Building a CNN architecture
- Training and validating the model
- Evaluating model performance
- Visualizing training results

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch (based on notebook)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (optional for evaluation)

## Dataset

The dataset used consists of labeled images for multiple classes (e.g., cats, dogs, pandas and bears). Images are loaded and preprocessed using standard resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques.

## CNN Architecture

The CNN consists of:

- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling layers for downsampling
- Flattening layer
- Fully connected (Dense) layers
- Output layer with Softmax activation for classification

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Set up the environment:
   - Python 3.x
   - Required libraries (install via pip install -r requirements.txt)
3. Update dataset path inside the notebook.
4. Run the notebook cell-by-cell.

## Results

- Accuracy and loss metrics are plotted during training.
- Confusion matrix or classification report is included for model performance.
- The final model achieves competitive accuracy depending on the dataset.

## Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning
- Deeper architectures or transfer learning (e.g., ResNet, VGG)
- Model deployment for real-time prediction
